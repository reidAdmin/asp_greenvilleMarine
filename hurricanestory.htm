            is every dealer�s nightmare. For Joe and Ann Vernelson, it became a 
            reality on September 16, 1999. Like much of North Carolina, the 
            Greenville-area business was hit by Hurricane Floyd and its damaging 
            wind gusts, downed trees, and wind-swept waters. �We sustained a lot 
            of damage from the hurricane itself, but our properties could have 
            survived that,� says Ann, who owns Greenville Marine with husband, 
            Joe. But it was flood waters the day after, not hurricane rains, 
            that swamped the dealership and most of the town.</span></font></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            �There was no warning,� recalls Ann. She says the hurricane waters 
            receded after Floyd passed by. But those waters were soon replaced 
            by significantly higher, significantly more damaging flood waters. 
            By the time the Vernelsons knew their town was in danger from the 
            swelling Tar River, the water was already lapping at the foundation 
            of their home and washing away their business.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">As 
            the river waters rose, the Vernelsons had little time to look after 
            material belongings. First, Joe retrieved a boat from the 
            dealership, knowing it would be needed. Then they were able to 
            rescue Joe�s mother and move her and their RV to safety. Soon after, 
            Joe found himself in a week-long struggle to save his neighbors and 
            the family business.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">�It 
            is hard to remember everything that happened,� he says. He does 
            remember going to work every day�sometimes by boat, via PWC, or on a 
            tractor�and helping out however he could. When he wasn�t securing 
            his own boats to poles and fences so that they wouldn�t be swept 
            away by the current, he was loaning boats and batteries to the 
            utilities people and participating in rescues. �I stayed in the 
            water seven days, working in a bathing suit.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">One 
            memory Joe says he won�t forget: helping a pregnant woman to safety, 
            just hours before she gave birth. �She had already walked a mile in 
            chest-high water, and by the time we saw her, she was exhausted. The 
            water was so high, I didn�t even know she was pregnant until we got 
            her in the boat,� he recalls. �Now she�s fine and the baby�s fine 
            too. But I�ll never forget seeing her working her way through that 
            water.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            Close to 50 people in eastern North Carolina were not so lucky, 
            losing their lives to what N.C. Governor Jim Hunt called 
            �devastation like we�ve never seen before.� Countless others lost 
            homes, businesses, and peace of mind. And the vast majority of these 
            people face the ramifications without any help from flood 
            insurance�the Vernelsons included.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            Combining their home and the losses to the business, Joe estimates 
            that the disaster will cost them about $1 million. While their house 
            is a total loss, the dealership buildings can be repaired. When the 
            five-foot-high wall of water broke through the showroom windows, 
            computers, records, and merchandise were ruined. �What happened to 
            us would have put us out of business if we hadn�t put money away for 
            a rainy day,� says Joe.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            <img hspace="5" src="images/instore.jpg" align="right" vspace="1" border="0" width="176" height="111">Now 
            interior walls are being replaced, floors have been ripped out and 
            are being redone, and parts shelves are being restocked. In essence, 
            they�ve had to strip the dealership bare and start over. �By the 
            time we�re up and running again, we will have been out of business 
            for three months,� Ann says. �It�ll take years for the area to be 
            back to normal.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">The 
            Vernelsons had an $8.5 million year last year, and expect that they 
            would have topped that this year. �But now we have to start over,� 
            says Joe. �I ain�t a quitter, so I have no choice. It scares me to 
            death to think about quitting. But now the hard thing is getting 
            motivated again.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            Care from the community has made it easier to keep going, say Joe 
            and Ann. Ann describes customers who come in with tears in their 
            eyes when they see the devastation. �We have to console them and 
            tell them that it�ll be all right,� she says. �It�s brought the 
            community closer together, bringing out the best in a lot of 
            people.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            <img hspace="5" src="images/sidestore2.jpg" align="left" vspace="1" border="0" width="201" height="108">The 
            dealership was just one eastern North Carolina business or residence 
            that benefited from volunteer help. �They came on a mission,� 
            recalls Joe of a group of young people who spent a day cleaning up 
            and painting in the dealership. �They restored my faith in the youth 
            of America again. It�s funny how disasters either bring out the best 
            or the worst in people. For most, it brought out the best.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            �Despite the fact that he was hit, too, Reggie Fountain was right 
            here making sure we were okay. Maycraft, Triton, and Sea Pro 
            actually gave us boats to help us get through. Eddie Smith was one 
            of the first people who called� and we don�t even carry Grady-White 
            anymore,� Joe recalls. He says most of his vendors really showed 
            support, and only one of his boat builders didn�t check in and offer 
            help.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            <span class="subheads">Living the dream<br>
            </span>�It was my dream,� says Joe. He had always wanted to sell 
            boats, and in September 1972, he made the dream come true. �The time 
            was right and the town was ready,� he says. So he quit his job at 
            the U.S. Post Office and opened Greenville Marine.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            �For eight years we didn�t go to lunch,� Joe remembers. �We�d sell 
            during the day and rig at night. We worked hard and were successful 
            as a result. We even made Mercury�s Dealer Congress the first year 
            we were in business.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">Joe 
            says they haven�t slowed down since, but many other things have 
            changed over the years. In 1976, faced with no room to expand 
            operations, they moved to a larger, highway-fronted facility on two 
            acres. Joe says he knew he had to find room to grow or get out of 
            the business. He chose growth�and grow he did.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">The 
            dealership has since expanded into a second building on the same 
            site�the new building is devoted to the Fountain powerboat operation 
            and the original one houses finance and sales offices, parts and 
            service, and an extensive tackle shop. The Vernelsons brought tackle 
            into the mix about three years ago, and say it�s since grown into an 
            impressive profit center.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            <img src="images/owners.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="149" height="138">The 
            Vernelson�s children, who were three and five years old when 
            Greenville Marine opened its doors for business, grew as well. 
            Having grown up in the dealership, both are key players in its 
            current success. Son Danny concentrates on sales, and spends most of 
            his time working as the Fountain sales manager. Daughter Kathy 
            Varnell is the controller, and will eventually take on the role of 
            general manager, explains Ann. Kathy�s husband, Joe Varnell, runs 
            the tackle division, and has been integral in its popularity among 
            local bass fishermen.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">Not 
            surprisingly, Greenville Marine�s lines have changed dramatically 
            over the years. The dealership started out with Dixie and now 
            carries some six lines of boats, including top-of-the-line Fountains 
            and Sea Rays. While they�ve introduced Yamaha and Johnson to the 
            power line-up, the dealership still carries Mercury, which the 
            Vernelsons worked hard to introduce to the area.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            �Our customers count on us to carry good product and stand behind 
            it,� says Joe. �They say, �if that�s the one you believe in, then 
            that�s the one we�ll buy.� If you take care of people, you can sell 
            any brand.�</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">
            �Service is our most important product,� adds Ann. �We try to sell 
            the best products we can, and then we strive to excel in servicing 
            those products.� She says it�s the only way a small business can 
            survive in a world of growing chain stores and retail outlets.</font></span></p>
            <p><span class="body"><font class="body" face="Verdana" size="2">And 
            that�s what business is all about at Greenville Marine. And that�s 
            what gives Joe and Ann the spirit to rebuild�in essence, to start 
            over.</font></span></p>
